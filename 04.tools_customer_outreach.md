Thought: None of the files directly discuss DeepLearningAI or general information about the Online Learning Platform sector. To move forward with creating a detailed profile of DeepLearningAI, including background, key personnel, and engagement strategies, I will need to search the internet for this specific information.

Action: Search the internet
Action Input: {"search_query": "DeepLearningAI company profile Online Learning Platform sector"} 

I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. This was the error: 'SERPER_API_KEY'.
 Tool Search the internet accepts these inputs: Search the internet(search_query: 'string') - A tool that can be used to semantic search a query from a txt's content.

Thought: Since the search for information on DeepLearningAI in the Online Learning Platform sector via the internet tool failed due to a technical issue, I am unable to directly gather new external data. Therefore, I need to synthesize information based on general knowledge about online learning platforms and typical profiles of companies in this sector. I will focus on common characteristics such as business model, key personnel, technological innovation, and customer engagement strategies.
